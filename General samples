// Sample : 1
let data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; // Added a new element '6'
let result = data.slice(0, 4); // Changed to slice the first four elements
console.log(result);

// Sample : 2
const aa = 5;
const bb = aa++;
const cc = aa + bb;
console.log(cc); // 11
// Explanation: aa is initially 5, bb is assigned the value of aa (5) before aa is incremented to 6. 
// Then cc is calculated as 6 (new value of aa) + 5 (value of bb), resulting in 11.

// Sample : 3
let xx = 4;
console.log(xx++ + ++xx); // 10
// Explanation: x is initially 4. The expression x++ evaluates to 4 (then x becomes 5), 
// and ++x increments x to 6 before evaluating to 6. So, the result is 4 + 6 = 10.

// Sample : 4
console.log(15%4); // 3
// Explanation: The remainder of 15 divided by 4 is 3.

// Sample : 5
let as=3;
let bs= new Number(3);
console.log(as==bs); // true
console.log(as===bs); // false
// Explanation: The == operator compares the values of a and b, which are equal.

// Sample : 6
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    sum += i;
}
console.log(sum); // 6
// Explanation: The loop iterates from 1 to 3, adding each value of i to the sum. The final sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

// Sample : 7
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = 15;
console.log(x < y < z); // true
// Explanation: The expression x < y < z is evaluated as (x < y) < z, which is true < z.
// The boolean value true is coerced to 1, so the expression becomes 1 < z, which is true.

// Sample : 8
let a = 10;
let b = (a === 10) ? 5 : 15;
console.log(b); // 5
// Explanation: The ternary operator checks if a is equal to 10. Since a is 10, the expression evaluates to true,
// and the value before the colon (5) is assigned to b.

// Sample : 9
const age1="24";
const age2=24;
console.log(age1==age2); // true
console.log(age1===age2); // false
console.log(+age1===age2); // true
// Explanation: The == operator compares the values of age1 and age2, which are equal.
// The === operator compares both the values and the types, which are not equal in this case.
// The + operator before age1 converts the string "24" to a number, making the comparison true.

// Sample : 10
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 20;
let num3 = 30;
console.log(num1 + num2 + num3); // 60
// Explanation: The numbers 10, 20, and 30 are added together to get 60.

// Sample : 11
let str1 = "Hello";
let str2 = "World";
console.log(str1 + " " + str2); // "Hello World"
// Explanation: The strings "Hello" and "World" are concatenated with a space in between to form "Hello World".

// Sample : 12
let bool1 = true;
let bool2 = false;
console.log(bool1 && bool2); // false
// Explanation: The logical AND (&&) operator returns false because one of the operands (bool2) is false.
