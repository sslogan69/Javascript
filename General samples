// Sample : 1
let data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; // Added a new element '6'
let result = data.slice(0, 4); // Changed to slice the first four elements
console.log(result);

// Sample : 2
const  aa = 5;
const bb = aa++;
const cc = aa + bb;
console.log(c); // 11
// Explanation: a is initially 5, b is assigned the value of a (5) before a is incremented to 6. 
// Then c is calculated as 6 (new value of a) + 5 (value of b), resulting in 11.

// Sample : 3
let xx = 4;
console.log(xx++ + ++xx); // 10
// Explanation: x is initially 4. The expression x++ evaluates to 4 (then x becomes 5), 
// and ++x increments x to 6 before evaluating to 6. So, the result is 4 + 6 = 10.

// Sample : 4
console.log(15%4); // 3
// Explanation: The remainder of 15 divided by 4 is 3.

// Sample : 5
let as=3;
let bs= new Number(3);
console.log(as==bs); // true
console.log(as===bs); // false
// Explanation: The == operator compares the values of a and b, which are equal.

// Sample : 6
let sum=0;
for(let i=1; i<=3; i++){
    sum += i;
}
console.log(sum);// 6
// Explanation: The loop iterates from 0 to 4, adding each value of i to the sum.

// Sample : 7
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = 15;
console.log(x < y < z); // true
// Explanation: The expression x < y < z is evaluated as (x < y) < z, which is true < z.
// The boolean value true is coerced to 1, so the expression becomes 1 < z, which is true.

// Sample : 8
let a = 10;
let b = (a === 10) ? 5 : 15;
console.log(b); // 5
// Explanation: The ternary operator checks if a is equal to 10. Since a is 10, the expression evaluates to true,
// and the value before the colon (5) is assigned to b.

// Sample : 9
const age1="24";
const age2=24;
console.log(age1==age2); // true
console.log(age1===age2); // false
console.log(+age1===age2); // true
// Explanation: The == operator compares the values of age1 and age2, which are equal.
// The === operator compares both the values and the types, which are not equal in this case.
// The + operator before age1 converts the string "24" to a number, making the comparison true.
